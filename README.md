# **!!! UNFINISHED !!!**
I am not continuing this project.  
ECS:R is dead bro  
Open button doesn't work.  
Basically no custom functions, and I don't even know if the ones implemented work  

Web executor for ECS:R.  
Not responsible if this gets you banned.  
Won't be maintained; it's already enough of a headache to develop.  
Has custom functions, but not really.  

## Loading
Turn on developer mode.  
Select "Load unpacked," and select the folder.  
Make sure the extension is turned on.  
When you join a game, just open the extension window from the extensions list and run your code.  

## Updating
This was and is a fucking nightmare to work on.  
Good luck.  
No exceptions.  
No function names.  
No strings.  
Somewhat. All strings are stored starting at address 0 until some point (maybe like 300,000 bytes in).  
If you know what you are doing, you can dump them, then look at the bytecode.  
No strings in the bytecode; you have to search for the address of the string.
